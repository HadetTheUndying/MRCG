Modular Raycast Gun

I put together this kit so that anyone, regardless of scripting capabilities, can make their own automatic raycast guns with great ease. I have packed lots of features in here, so even advanced scripters may find it beneficial to just drop these scripts into their weaponry to quickly and effortlessly script their automatic raycast guns, and then simply tweak the settings at the top of the core script for varying results (though I find the default settings rather effective and balanced.)

Some benefits of RC over projectiles: 
- severely less script lag (if any) 
- severely less physics lag (if any) 
- severely less rez queue (if any) 
- hit reports and audio/visual feedback 
- kill tracking 
- no cheesing (you can't just sit across a sim behind a barricade, poke out and fire a stream of frenchfries across the sim hoping to hit someone regardless if there's line of sight to anyone or not, and then duck back behind cover like a tiny babu) 
- "range" has a meaning (damage falloff, and the innate fact that it's much more difficult to hit with raycast at varying distances when you have spread) 
- sim builds don't need 5-meter-thick or thicker walls to block bullets (though you can still script slower-firing RC guns to have bullet penetration where you can define a maximum "wall thickness" that it can penetrate though) 
- can adjusted to do a variable amount of LBA damage (not just 1 per shot) 
- can be easily synced with things such as currency systems, combat meters, ammo systems, and various combat features such as killstreaks
